<p>The purpose of CS 501 is to prepare the Computer Science TAs for teaching in the classroom environment. TAs are not expected to have any prior teaching experience, so this course will help them achieve confidence in the classroom, grade equitably and efficiently, teach to various learning styles and establish their personal teaching philosophies. The course is given to both students who will be TAing concurrently in the fall quarter and those who hope to TA in the future.</p>

<p>Your time as a graduate student is precious and limited. Thus, you'll only need to complete the following list of requirements to pass the course. For the entire fall quarter, please expect to spend a total of 5 hours in class, and around 5-8 hours after class. Spread across the quarter, the workload comes out to be just above <strong>1 hour per week</strong> in combined in-class and out-of-class time, which I hope is manageable.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-cit"><a class="header" href="#what-is-cit">What is CIT?</a></h2>
<p>The Certificate in Inclusive Teaching (CIT) is designed for UCSB graduate students and postdocs, to help them foster inclusive classrooms, effectively mentor a diverse student body, and enhance their professional development. The CIT program offers a series of workshops in each academic quarter. Each workshop is typically 1 hour long, and you can attend any one of them to fulfill this assignment.</p>
<p>Note that for CS 501, you only need to <strong>attend 1 workshop</strong> from <strong>any area</strong> in the fall quarter. However, if you want to receive the actual CIT certificate, you need to attend 4 workshops (1 from each area). You're more than welcome, but are not required, to attend more workshops to work towards the full certificate if you find the workshops useful! Descriptions of CIT program can be found <a href="https://otl.ucsb.edu/graduate-students/ta-certificate-programs/cit">on their website</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The short-term goal is just to get you started on thinking about inclusive teaching practices, and help you work towards the CIT certificate: you'll have 1 out of 4 completed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The long-term goal is to prepare you for your future teaching assignments and potentially for a career in academia, which almost always involves teaching in some form or another.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> The CIT workshops are a great entry point to UCSB's <a href="https://otl.ucsb.edu/">outstanding teaching resources</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Help you with time management!
<ul>
<li>TA’ing can eat up a TON of time if you’re not careful</li>
<li>Make sure you’re not overworked by your instructor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Help you reflect on what you learned about teaching
<ul>
<li>Your weekly reflections are great fodder for your teaching philosophy statement!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do"><a class="header" href="#what-you-need-to-do">What you need to do</a></h2>
<p>Junrui will create a Canvas assignment for you to submit your journal entry every week. In your journal entry, please do the following two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log <strong>how much time</strong> you spent on <strong>what</strong> teaching-related duties. Be sure to include <em>all</em> teaching-related duties, including but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Holding office hours</li>
<li>Preparing for and running sections</li>
<li>Answering student questions on Piazza or other Q&amp;A platforms</li>
<li>Grading assignments</li>
<li>Debugging autograders and student submissions</li>
<li>Meeting with your instructor or fellow TAs</li>
<li>Attending CS 501</li>
<li>Slacking off because you don't wanna work on your research (just kidding)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reflect on your experiences in the past week of teaching. Feel free to choose one or more <strong>prompts</strong> from the list below and respond to it. No need to write a full essay, just a few sentences is fine!
<ul>
<li>What went well in your teaching this week? What didn't go so well?</li>
<li>What is something surprising/unexpected that happened in your section/office hours?</li>
<li>What strategies have you tried, or want to try, in your teaching?</li>
<li>How do you feel what you have learned in CS 501 so far can be applied to your teaching?</li>
<li>What is one thing you want to improve in your teaching next week?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Who</strong>: Non-TAs</p>
<p><strong>Deadline</strong>: By the end of the fall quarter</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time</strong>: 1 hour</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For non-TAs, how can you possibly get better at something if you never actually practice it? Well, you can learn a lot just by observing and learning from how others are doing it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For TAs, this is a good source of feedback on your teaching from your homies. Normally you only get feedback from your students at the end of the quarter (and mid-quarter if you're lucky), which is often too late to be useful. But because the economy is so bad and there're so few of you who got TA positions, you'll likely have <em>several</em> non-TA peers observing your teaching and giving you feedback throughout the quarter. How great is that? :)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do-1"><a class="header" href="#what-you-need-to-do-1">What you need to do</a></h2>
<h3 id="if-you-are-a-ta"><a class="header" href="#if-you-are-a-ta">If you are a TA...</a></h3>
<p>Use <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ta-obs">this Google sheet</a> to kindly provide information on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name &amp; email</li>
<li>The course you're TA'ing for</li>
<li>Are you leading lab or discussion sections?</li>
<li>The day(s) and time(s) of your section</li>
<li>The location of your section (Zoom link or physical location).</li>
</ul>
<p>Once all of you've filled out the sheet, Junrui will consolidate the information and share it with non-TAs in the class. Please expect to receive emails/discord DMs from your fellow non-TA classmates asking to observe your section. Please be accommodating and let them know that you're happy to have them observe your teaching!</p>
<p>Other than that, you don't need to do anything else. Just teach your section as you normally would, and enjoy the extra company!</p>
<h3 id="if-you-are-a-non-ta"><a class="header" href="#if-you-are-a-non-ta">If you are a non-TA...</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Once Junrui has collected the information from TAs, he will share a sign-up sheet with you.</li>
<li>Please pick one TA's section to observe. You can pick any TA you want, and any section that fits your schedule.</li>
<li>Please reach out to the TA (via email/discord/in person) to let them know that you'd like to observe their section, and confirm the day/time/location with them.</li>
<li>Put your name on the sign-up sheet next to the TA's section that you're observing. We want to make sure that no section is overwhelmed with observers!</li>
<li>On the day of the section, use <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d0IeOFE5Soyo-q8JPV8hFvtKkg9OkgjN/view?usp=sharing">this TA observation form</a> to provide <strong>constructive feedback</strong> to the TA on their teaching. Please be kind and respectful in your feedback. Put yourself in their shoes: what kind of feedback would you want to receive if you were the TA?</li>
<li>After the section, please send a copy of your filled-out observation form to the TA.</li>
<li>Finally, upload the filled-out observation form to the corresponding Canvas assignment--this allows Junrui to keep track of who has completed the assignment.</li>
