# Teaching Journal

> **Who**: TAs
>
> **Deadline**: Weekly, by Sunday 11:59pm
>
> **Estimated time**: 5-10 minutes per week


## Why Junrui wants you to do this
1. Help you with time management!
   - TA’ing can eat up a TON of time if you’re not careful
   - Make sure you’re not overworked by your instructor
2. Help you reflect on what you learned about teaching
   - Your weekly reflections are great fodder for your teaching philosophy statement!



## What you need to do
Junrui will create a Canvas assignment for you to submit your journal entry every week. In your journal entry, please do the following two things:
1. Log **how much time** you spent on **what** teaching-related duties. Be sure to include *all* teaching-related duties, including but not limited to:
   - Holding office hours
   - Preparing for and running sections
   - Answering student questions on Piazza or other Q&A platforms
   - Grading assignments
   - Debugging autograders and student submissions
   - Meeting with your instructor or fellow TAs
   - Attending CS 501
   - Slacking off because you don't wanna work on your research (just kidding)
2. Reflect on your experiences in the past week of teaching. Feel free to choose one or more **prompts** from the list below and respond to it. No need to write a full essay, just a few sentences is fine!
   - What went well in your teaching this week? What didn't go so well?
   - What is something surprising/unexpected that happened in your section/office hours?
   - What strategies have you tried, or want to try, in your teaching?
   - How do you feel what you have learned in CS 501 so far can be applied to your teaching?
   - What is one thing you want to improve in your teaching next week?
