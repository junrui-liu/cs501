# Attend a CIT Workshop

> **Who**: Everyone
> 
> **Deadline**: By the end of the fall quarter
>
> **Estimated time**: 1 hour

## What is CIT?

The Certificate in Inclusive Teaching (CIT) is designed for UCSB graduate students and postdocs, to help them foster inclusive classrooms, effectively mentor a diverse student body, and enhance their professional development. The CIT program offers a series of workshops in each academic quarter. Each workshop is typically 1 hour long, and you can attend any one of them to fulfill this assignment.

Note that for CS 501, you only need to **attend 1 workshop** from **any area** in the fall quarter. However, if you want to receive the actual CIT certificate, you need to attend 4 workshops (1 from each area). You're more than welcome, but are not required, to attend more workshops to work towards the full certificate if you find the workshops useful! Descriptions of CIT program can be found [on their website](https://otl.ucsb.edu/graduate-students/ta-certificate-programs/cit).


## Why Junrui wants you to do this

- The short-term goal is just to get you started on thinking about inclusive teaching practices, and help you work towards the CIT certificate: you'll have 1 out of 4 completed!

- The long-term goal is to prepare you for your future teaching assignments and potentially for a career in academia, which almost always involves teaching in some form or another.[^1] The CIT workshops are a great entry point to UCSB's [outstanding teaching resources](https://otl.ucsb.edu/).

[^1]: Even if you just do research, you'll likely have to mentor people more junior than you, which is a form of teaching!

## How do I attest that I attended a workshop?

Junrui will create a Canvas assignment where you will submit the name of the workshop you attended, the date you attended it, and a brief reflection (1-2 sentences) on what you learned from the workshop.
