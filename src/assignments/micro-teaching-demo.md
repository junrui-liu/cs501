# (Non-TA) Micro-Teaching Demo

In the 2nd half of the quarter, each of you will have an teaching demo.
- Pick one course you feel excited to TA for.
- Then, pick one topic covered in that course.
- Prepare a 5-7 min presentation in class.
- You can incorporate slides, boardwork, worksheets...

## Logistics:
1. Sign up by Tuesday, Oct 28 (link in Week 4 slides).
2. Before the demo day, submit to Canvas a [lesson plan](https://otl.ucsb.edu/resources/course-planning/lesson-planning) containing at least one learning objective and your planned activities.
3. If you want to print any handouts, let Junrui know at least 3 hours in advance. Junrui will print them and bring them to class. FREE!
4. Show up on the day of class you signed up for! You *only* need to show up for your own demo day.
5. Your peers + Junrui will listen and give you constructive feedback.
